KOP stands for (__K__EM-based __O__T)-based __P__ET,
which uses the following acronyms:
- KEM: Key Encapsulation Mechanism
- OT: Oblivious Transfer
- PET: Private Equality Test

The KOP allows secure comparison of low-entropy values, which can be used (for
example) in Off-the-Record messaging (OTR) for user authentication. In OTR
version 2/3/4, this is done with the Socialist Millionaire Protocol.
That protocol is based on the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange.
