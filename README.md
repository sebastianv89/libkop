libkop
======

KOP stands for (*K*EM-based *O*T)-based *P*EC,
which uses the following acronyms:
- KEM: Key Encapsulation Mechanism
- OT: Oblivious Transfer
- PEC: Private Equality Confirmation

The KOP allows secure comparison of low-entropy values, which can be used (for
example) in Off-the-Record Messaging (OTR) for user authentication. In OTR
version 2/3/4, this is done with the Socialist Millionaire Protocol.  That
protocol is based on the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange, which is not secure
against quantum adversaries.

Instead the KOP protocol can (in principle) be instantiated with any KEM,
including the post-quantum secure ones currently being developed. The current
prototype uses [Kyber][kyber], as provided by [liboqs][oqs]. The protocol must
be executed over a [pseudo-authenticated channel][bclpr07], which is
instantiated with [Dilithium][dilithium] signatures.

This work accompanies my thesis and relies on the work done by Masny,
Rindal and Rosulek [rr17], [mr19].


Compiling
---------

In order to compile the library, make sure that the following libraries are installed:
 - [libXKCP][https://github.com/XKCP/XKCP] (make sure the KeccakHash service is enabled)
 - [libdecaf][https://sourceforge.net/projects/ed448goldilocks/]
 - [liboqs][https://openquantumsafe.org/liboqs/]


Testing
-------

Once compiled, build the `all` target to build all test-files.
Run each `test_*` target to test the corresponding functionality.
(`test_kop` tests the overall functionality).
Run `test_speed` for benchmarking the code.
