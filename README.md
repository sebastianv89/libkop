KOP stands for (*K*EM-based *O*T)-based *P*ET,
which uses the following acronyms:
- KEM: Key Encapsulation Mechanism
- OT: Oblivious Transfer
- PET: Private Equality Test

The KOP allows secure comparison of low-entropy values, which can be used (for
example) in Off-the-Record messaging (OTR) for user authentication. In OTR
version 2/3/4, this is done with the Socialist Millionaire Protocol.  That
protocol is based on the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange, which is not secure
against quantum adversaries.

Instead the KOP protocol can (in principle) be instantiated with any KEM,
including the post-quantum secure ones currently being developed. The current
prototype uses [Kyber][kyber], as provided by [liboqs][oqs].

This work accompanies my upcoming paper and relies on the work done by Masny,
Rindal and Rosulek [rr17], [mr19].
